# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

This project is part of the **Professional Certification in Data Analytics from Google.**

In a glimpse:

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share service. with 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. 
Its pricing plans are: 
- Single-ride passes
- Full-day passes
- Annual memberships. 

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

This analysis is for 2022 data, the dataset can be accessed in the following link:

As a part of the work, I want to share my professional takeaways from this project:

## 1. Handle large datasets requires proper tools
This dataset has 73 million records, for that kind of data size you cannot use excel and neither clean the dataset or create a graph in the same way. For this analysis y used my local computer with Anaconda, jupyter studio, and python. 
## 2. Data analysis involves discipline and “sticking to the process”
When you have all this data, is easy to get annoyed or lost. Using a method to examine, evaluate and weigh different alternatives helps to get what you are asked to do faster. Also prevents giving recommendations based on bias. 
## 3. Intuition is important
To some extent, this takeaway is the opposite of what I just said about bias, but to understand data I required to explore different combinations of data. That just can be done with intuition.
## 4. Making sense of information requires time
I took me nearly 40% of the time of this project understanding patterns and trying graphs that didn´t show anything useful for the recommendations section. But this time is not wasted because it gave me certainty.
## 5. Data Analysis is very personal
Because this case study has been done and published by hundreds if not thousands of analysts, I explored different approaches, multiple tools used, and ways of sharing. Those perspectives in my case helped me to understand better how they approach the case.  Some of my graphs were the same as others but I had some of my own. For example, I didn´t find heatmap code anywhere else.

If you are reading this, and want to share something will be nice.
Thanks and I hope you have a good time!
